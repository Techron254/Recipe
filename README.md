I believe I got everything right except one small problem: The Outfit font I was provided with only had one variant which was the regular type of font weight 400 so everything i did with it that required bold and font weight of above 400 could't come out. The Young Serif font was fine and it had a lot of varieties and weights so it worked superb. I'm still figuring out if there is a way around this If I find one i will update the code otherwise that's the best we've got for now.
