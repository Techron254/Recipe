I believe I got everything right except one small problem: The Young Serif font I was provided with only had one variant, which was the regular type of font weight 400 so everything I did with it that required bold and font weight of above 400 couldn't come out. The Young Outfit font was fine, and it had a lot of varieties and weights, so it worked superbly. I'm still figuring out if there is a way around this. If I find one, I will update the code; otherwise, that's the best we've got for now.
